Idiyappam is an easy to make and delicious South Indian steamed rice noodle. Made simply from rice flour, it becomes perfect to mop up delicious curries.


Ingredients
Water - 2 Cups (*refer to notes)
Oil (preferably Gingelly oil) - 1 tsp + more as needed
Rice flour | Idiyappam flour - 1 1/2 Cups
Salt - 1/4 tsp
First, add the oil to the water and bring it to a boil. Once the water starts to boil, turn off the flame.
In a separate bowl, add the rice flour, salt and mix well. Add about 3/4 Cup of the hot water to the rice flour. Stir with a spatula. Now, continue to add the water little by little to the rice flour and mix well until a soft, smooth and non-sticky dough is formed.
Once you are able to handle the dough by hand, knead it nicely for 1-2 mins. Grease the inside portion of the idiyappam press. Grease your palm with oil, take a portion of the dough, smoothen it out in your palm and fill it in the press. Similarly, grease the steamer plate. Gently press the idiyappam dough onto the steamer plate, as shown in the pic.
Steam the idiyappam for about 5 mins, until cooked through. Let the idiyapam to cool down a bit, before gently removing from the steamer plate and transferring to a serving plate.
Enjoy hot with a side of spicy kurma or sweetened coconut milk.
Notes
- Water required to make the dough cannot be precisely quantified. It depends completely on the rice flour used. Hence, add water little by little until the desired dough consistency is required.
- I needed only about 1 1/4 Cups of water for 1 1/2 Cups of the flour.
- If your dough is dry, pressing will be difficult and the idiyappam will turn out tough.
- If your dough is watery, the idiyappam strands will stick to each other while cooking.
- Do not overcook the idiyappam, or else it will become tough / rubbery.
- If making a large batch, keep the dough covered with wet cloth.
- Though I have not personally tested / recommend the following product from amazon, you can refer to this link for getting an idea about idiyappam press.
- Suggested Side Dish for Idiyappam:
Savory Kurma or Sweetened Coconut Milk (Coconut Milk + Sugar + Cardamom pods)
